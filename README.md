# Password Manager
 A place to store all your important passwords.

# Instructions
 Run the main.py file and enter the master password that you have chosen; you can view, add, or delete your existing passwords. The information is saved in the emails.txt file, but it is encrypted, so no one can see the information without logging onto the app with the master password.
